# Final Capstone: Task Management System

This project is a Task Management System that allows users to add tasks, view all tasks, and view their own tasks. The system is designed to facilitate task assignment and management within an organisation or team. It also generates reports on task completion and overdue tasks, as well as user-specific reports on task assignments and completion rates.
